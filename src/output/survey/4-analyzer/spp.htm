      <td>Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.</td>

      <td>SummaryBlockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer‐to‐peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.Study presents a review on security threats and vulnerabilities in existing cryptocurrency systems that include the possibility of attacks with a focus on issues related to user privacy and transaction anonymity. The real attacks on blockchain systems are investigated, and current possible countermeasure methods by attack types are discussed. Furthermore, practical and academic merits to enhance the security of blockchain and limitations of state‐of‐the‐art security solutions are summarized and discussed, and future directions in area of blockchain security are suggested.\n\n                            View Figure\n</td>

And a good consensus mechanism plays a very important role in the stable operation of the Blockchain system. The continuous improvement of consensus mechanisms such as PoW (proof-of-work), PoS (proof-of-stake), DPoS (delegated-proof-of-stake), and PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) has led to the evolution of Blockchain technology to Blockchain 3.0. Starting from the issue of Byzantine generals, this article analyzes common consensus mechanisms based on existing Blockchain applications and then evaluates their consistency. This paper has a unique perspective, selection and comment on the latest progress and important literature in the field of block chain. At last, it also has a high degree of summary and prospect to the existing problems and the future development trend.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many application domains. While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing—Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.</td>

      <td>As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.</td>

This work discusses the process of assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a consensus protocols exposed to faults and adversarial nodes. We advocate to follow the established practice in cryptography and computer security, relying on public reviews, detailed models, and formal proofs; the designers of several practical systems appear to be unaware of this. Moreover, we review the consensus protocols in some prominent permissioned blockchain platforms with respect to their fault models and resilience against attacks.

This will have an effect on a wide range of domains, from the Internet of Things to autonomous mobile robots. The integration of such a variety of MEC services in a inherently distributed architecture requires a robust system for managing hardware resources, balancing the network load and securing the distributed applications. Blockchain technology has emerged a solution for managing MEC services, with consensus protocols and data integrity checks that enable transparent and efficient distributed decision-making. In addition to transparency, the benefits from a security point of view are evident. Nonetheless, blockchain technology faces significant challenges in terms of scalability. In this chapter, we review existing consensus protocols and scalability techniques in both well-established and next-generation blockchain architectures. From this, we evaluate the most suitable solutions for managing MEC services and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the available alternatives.</td>

Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) guarantee the provenance and traceability of the data by providing a transparent, immutable and verifiable record of transactions while creating a peer-to-peer platform for exchanging, storing and securing information. This article aims to explore the potential of DLTs and blockchain to combat fake news, reviewing initiatives that are currently under development and identifying their main current challenges. Moreover, some recommendations are enumerated to guide future researchers on issues that will have to be tackled to face fake news, as an integral part of strengthening the resilience against cyber-threats of today's online media.</td>

In this paper, we formalize metatransactions, review existing ideas, and describe novel metatransaction design approaches. Under the assumption of sufficient market liquidity, we argue that metatransactions do not lower the security of cryptocurrency platforms. However, without changing the underlying blockchain, metatransaction designs typically increase transaction costs and reduce the blockchain transaction throughput.</td>

However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain. Motivated by this, this paper provides a review regarding the intersection of IDSs and blockchains.

      <td>Bitcoin is the most widely known distributed, peer-to-peer payment network without existence of a central authority. In Bitcoin, users do not use real names; instead, pseudonyms are used. Managing and verifying transactions and issuing of bitcoins are performed collectively by peers in the network. Since pseudonyms are used without providing any identity, it is perceived that Bitcoin provides anonymity. However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. This survey presents an overview and detailed investigation of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin-like digital cash systems. We examine the studies in the literature/Web in two major categories: 1) analyses of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin and 2) extensions and alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. We list and describe methods and outcomes for both categories and group studies according to these methods and outcomes. We also present relationships between outcomes of analyses and the improvement methods. We compare performances of the methods and show relationships between the proposals. Moreover, we present guidelines for designing an anonymity/privacy improvement and discuss future research directions.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology has been developed for more than ten years and has become a trend in various industries. As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.</td>

      <td>Network security is consequential prospect while working over the internet, LAN or other networks. Data security must be high precedence when it comes to network setup. Data security assures that shared data is kept secure. In the network, data security is crucial against attackers and hackers. The data security is all about first to secure the information from pirated access and the second one is to protect from thwart hackers. The objective of network security is to keep the network running and safe for all legitimate users. The target of this paper is to present the merits and demerits of blockchain over data security in different sectors. The blockchain technology is used in various applications to store exchanges of values via transactions. All transactions made by nodes are signed digitally with the preceding transaction hash and the public key of the destination node; this scheme guarantees that transactions are tamper-proof. A block containing transactions will be approved by specific blockchain nodes. In block-chain technology, each page in a ledger of transactions forms a block. That block affects the next block or page through cryptographic hashing. In other words, when a block is finally completed, it creates a special secure code, that links to the next page or block, creating a chain of blocks, or block-chain. Data security can be accomplished using the block-chain concept. The hash tables of raw data files are stored on the blockchain, and other copies are validated by a hashing technique. Thus any interference with the data will be instantly found because the initial hash tables are stored on thousands of nodes.</td>

To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains.

The code does the execution without giving either party the ability to back out, so it ensures the trustless execution. The smart contract is one of the most important features in blockchain applications, which implements trusted transactions without third parties. However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate. So, we further present representative studies of formal verification of smart contracts in detail to demonstrate that using a formal method to validate blockchain smart contracts must have a promising and meritorious future.</td>

In the last two decades, numerous IoT solutions have been developed by small, medium-sized, and large enterprises to make our lives easier. Furthermore, private and academic researchers have extensively investigated some practical IoT solutions. The rapid expansion of IoT solutions accompanies numerous security concerns because the underlying IoT protocols and communication technologies have not considered security. Recently, blockchain has emerged to become one of the promising technologies that might overcome some of the IoT limitations (security limitations, in particular). Blockchain technology is a database ledger that uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and stores transactions and asset registries. Blockchain can be described as a mounting list of records (i.e., blocks) with the following properties: distributed, decentralized, immutable, and shared. This paper surveyed recent security advances to overcome IoT limitations using blockchain. In this article, the blockchain attempts to overcome IoT limitations that are related to cyber security have been classified into four categories: end-to-end traceability; data privacy and anonymity; identity verification and authentication; and confidentiality, data integrity, and availability (CIA).

Examples of leaking information constitute the amounts spent, the goods on which the amounts were spent, the spending locations and the users we exchange money with. This knowledge is powerful in the hands of those who have it, and can be used in multiple ways, not always to our benefit. Cryptocurrencies, such as the famous Bitcoin, were proposed as a means to address the limitations of centralized banking systems and to offer its users privacy with regards to their transactional data. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review on the realm of privacy for electronic currencies. We present the development of digital money from electronic cash to cryptocurrencies and focus on the techniques that are employed to enhance user-privacy. Furthermore, we present flaws of the current cryptocurrency systems, which reduce the privacy of the cryptocurrency users. Finally, we describe three research directions to enhance privacy for cryptocurrencies: transaction propagation mechanisms, succinct ZK proof systems without a trusted setup, and specialised trustless zero-knowledge proofs.</td>

This review focuses on how the blockchain addresses scalability challenges and provides solutions in the healthcare field through the implementation of blockchain technology. Accordingly, 16 solutions fell under two main areas, namely storage optimization and redesign of blockchain. However, limitations persist, including block size, high volume of data, transactions, number of nodes, and protocol challenges. This review consists of six stages, namely identification of research question, procedures of research, screening of relevant articles, keywording based on the abstract, data extraction, and mapping process. Through Atlas.ti software, the selected keywords were used to analyse through the relevant articles. As a result, 48 codes and 403 quotations were compiled. Manual coding was performed to categorise the quotations. The codes were then mapped onto the network as a mapping process. Notably, 16 solutions fell under two main areas, namely storage optimization and redesign of blockchain. Basically, there are 3 solutions compiled for storage optimization and 13 solutions for the redesign of the blockchain, namely blockchain modelling, read mechanism, write mechanism, and bi-directional network.</td>

Most of the devices involved in blockchain-related processes are specially designed targeting only the mining aspect, i.e., solving the computational puzzle task. At the same time, the use of wearable and mobile devices may also become a part of eCommerce blockchain operation, especially during the on-charge time. The paper considers the possibility of using a large number of constrained devices to support the operation of the blockchain with a low impact on battery consumption. The utilization of such devices is expected to improve the system efficiency as well as to attract a more substantial number of users. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge with a survey of the main applications of blockchain for smartphones along with existing mobile blockchain projects. It also proposes a novel consensus protocol based on a combination of Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Activity (PoA), and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithms for efficient and on-the-fly utilization on resource-constrained devices. The system was deployed in a worldwide testnet with more than two thousand smartphones and compared with other projects from the user-experienced metrics perspective. The results prove that the utilization of PoA systems on a smartphone does not significantly affect the lifetime of the smartphone battery while existing methods based on PoW have a tremendous negative impact. Finally, the main open challenges and future investigation directions are outlined.</td>

      <td>Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain &amp; logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures.

In particular, we focus on sharding as a promising first layer solution to the scalability issue; the basic idea behind sharding is to divide the blockchain network into multiple committees, each processing a separate set of transactions. More specifically, (a) we propose a taxonomy based on committee formation and intra-committee consensus; and (b) we compare the main existing sharding-based blockchain protocols.

In SDN, the network intelligence is centralized in a software entity so-called SDN controller, which enables network administrators to dynamically manage, secure, and optimize network resources and programmatically shape all entire network traffic pattern. Despite the impressive benefits SDN has brought to network architecture, it introduces new security challenges and prompts different implementation strategies to spread attack vectors.

These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture. In this paper, we review the state-of-art application of Blockchain in 5G network and explore how it can facilitate enabling technologies of 5G and beyond to enable various services at the front-haul, edge and the core.

Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm.

To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.</td>

However, blockchain confronts some privacy risks that hinder its practical applications. Though numerous surveys reviewed the privacy preservation in blockchain, they failed to reveal the latest advances, nor have they been able to conduct a unified standard comprehensive classification of the privacy protection of permissionless blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the specific characteristics of permissionless blockchain, summarize the potential privacy threats, and investigate the unique privacy requirements of blockchain.

Backward-reference list checking was conducted to identify other relevant references. Study selection process was performed in three steps based on PRISMA flow diagram. Extracted data were synthesised and presented narratively using tables and figures.ResultsThe search resulted in 84 relevant studies that have been conducted of which only 37 unique studies were included in this review. Eight benefits of blockchain were categorised in either patient related-benefits (security and authorisation, personalised healthcare, patients' health data tracking, and patient’s health status monitoring) or organisational-related benefits (health information exchange, pharmaceutical supply chain, clinical trials, and medical insurance management). Meanwhile, eight threats of blockchain were categorised into three groups: organisational threats (installation and transaction costs, interoperability issues, and lack of technical skills), social threats (social acceptance and regulations issues), and technological threats (scalability issues, authorisation and security issues, high energy consumption, and slow processing speeds).ConclusionBlockchain is a viable technology that can improve the healthcare data sharing and storing system owing to its decentralisation, immutability, transparency and traceability features. However, many healthcare organisations remain hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to threats such as security and authorisation issues, interoperability issues and lack of technical skills related to blockchain technology.</td>

      <td>Highlights•Operational mechanisms and functional characteristics of blockchain technology are presented.•Blockchain-based IoT architecture is proposed for traceability issues.•Potential benefits and challenges of blockchain technology in traceability application is reviewed.•A future research of blockchain technology for traceability sustainability is discussed.AbstractTraceability plays a vital role in food quality and safety management. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) traceability systems provide the feasible solutions for the quality monitoring and traceability of food supply chains. However, most of the IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm that makes it difficult for consumers to acquire all transaction information and to track the origins of products. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that has great potential for improving traceability performance by providing security and full transparency. However, the benefits, challenges and development methods of blockchain-based food traceability systems are not yet fully explored in the current literature. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to review the blockchain technology characteristics and functionalities, identify blockchain-based solutions for addressing food traceability concerns, highlight the benefits and challenges of blockchain-based traceability systems implementation, and help researchers and practitioners to apply blockchain technology based food traceability systems by proposing an architecture design framework and suitability application analysis flowchart of blockchain based food traceability systems. The results of this study contribute to better understanding and knowledge on how to improve the food traceability by developing and implementing blockchain-based traceability systems. The paper provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners on the use of blockchain-based food traceability management and has a positive effect on the improvement of food sustainability.</td>

      <td>AbstractThe recent advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in terms of manufacturing processes, and communication and networking technology has led to a rise in their usage in civilian and commercial applications. The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard. We also discuss various challenges to be addressed in the integration of blockchain and UAVs and suggest some future research directions.</td>

By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.</td>

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.</td>

A new technology, Blockchain, may be a key to addressing these challenges and should draw the attention of the whole clinical research community.Blockchain brings the Internet to its definitive decentralisation goal. The core principle of Blockchain is that any service relying on trusted third parties can be built in a transparent, decentralised, secure “trustless” manner at the top of the Blockchain (in fact, there is trust, but it is hardcoded in the Blockchain protocol via a complex cryptographic algorithm). Therefore, users have a high degree of control over and autonomy and trust of the data and its integrity. Blockchain allows for reaching a substantial level of historicity and inviolability of data for the whole document flow in a clinical trial. Hence, it ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction and allows for securely automating the clinical trial through what are called Smart Contracts. At the same time, the technology ensures fine-grained control of the data, its security and its shareable parameters, for a single patient or group of patients or clinical trial stakeholders.In this commentary article, we explore the core functionalities of Blockchain applied to clinical trials and we illustrate concretely its general principle in the context of consent to a trial protocol. Trying to figure out the potential impact of Blockchain implementations in the setting of clinical trials will shed new light on how modern clinical trial methods could evolve and benefit from Blockchain technologies in order to tackle the aforementioned challenges.</td>

      <td>Ride-hailing service is gaining an increasing popularity due to its great advantages on fare estimation, automatic payments, and reputation ratings. However, how to build the trust between the driver and the passenger and achieve the secure billing still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel secure billing protocol which removes the presence of the online third party by a smart contract on a publicly-verifiable two-party blockchain. In the proposed secure billing protocol, the driver and the passenger generate a blockchain which contains information about the ride. The driver and the passenger measure their own trajectories respectively in rounds. At the end of each round, they exchange their trajectories of the current round. If the difference of trajectories is within a threshold, they jointly compute the fare of current round. After completing the computation, the passenger pays the driver the fare of the current round via a micropayment channel. The driver and the passenger end each round by adding the information generated in this round into the blockchain. The blockchain can be considered as an evidence of the ride since it contains all the information of the ride. We evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol via extensive experiments and detailed analysis.</td>

In a cyber-physical system-of-systems (CPSoS), systems communicate by exchanging and sharing data and information, which this chapter also refers to as interoperability of information. To ensure reliable and secure interoperability of information between distributed cyber-physical systems, using blockchain technology or distributed ledging technology for distributed entities is an interesting option. Such a blockchain must, at a minimum, be fault tolerant and enable the entities involved to reach consensus on the information transactions that are to be performed. Once consensus about transactions between cyber-physicals is reached, it must be possible for these to record consistently the used data in a distributed ledger that provides a permanent shared overview of completed information transactions. The development of the new technology we call blockchain creates a new and as yet unfathomable reality of interconnected autonomous and self-organising cyber-physical systems that have the ability to make decisions about or for us as human beings.</td>

This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner’s authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.</td>

A smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and some parties, where the parties deposit assets into the contract and the contract redistributes the assets among the parties based on provisions of the smart contract and inputs of the parties. Recently, several smart contract systems are constructed that use zk-SNARKs to provide privacy-preserving payments and interconnections in the contracts (e.g. Hawk [KMS+16] and Gyges [JKS16]). Efficiency of such systems severely are dominated by efficiency of the underlying UC-secure zk-SNARK that is achieved using C\(\emptyset \)C\(\emptyset \) framework [KZM+15] applied on a non-UC-secure zk-SNARK. In this paper, we show that recent progresses on zk-SNARKs, allow one to simplify the structure and also improve the efficiency of both systems with a UC-secure zk-SNARK that has simpler construction and better efficiency in comparison with the currently used ones. More precisely, with minimal changes, we present a variation of Groth and Maller’s zk-SNARK from Crypto 2017, and show that it achieves UC-security and has better efficiency than the ones that currently are used in Hawk and Gyges. We believe, new variation can be of independent interest.\n\n</td>

All the transactions of cryptocurrencies are stored in chronological order to help users in tracking the transactions without maintaining any central record of the transactions. Application prospects of blockchain are promising and have been delivering the result since its inception. Blockchain technology has evolved from initial cryptocurrency to new-age smart contracts and has been implemented and applied in many fields. Although a lot of studies have been carried out on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, but a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems is still missing. In this chapter, we will try to demonstrate a systematic illustration on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We will discuss the security and the privacy of blockchain along with their impact with regards to different trends and applications in this chapter. The chapter is intended to discuss key security attacks and the enhancements that will help develop better blockchain systems.</td>

      <td>The introduction and enactment of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have initiated a global revolution. The volume and variety of data that are collected and processed in industries are ever increasing due to the widespread acceptance of modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, edge computing, and cloud storage. Conventional systems with centralized architecture are not designed to handle the complexity and scale of data that is processed in IIoT operations. Moreover, the threat of security and privacy breaches also increases with the growth of IIoT-connected devices. IoT devices often tend to have poor security defense systems due to low processing power, limited storage capabilities, and poor manufacturing standards. In this context, blockchain technology can help to eliminate the security vulnerabilities faced by the IIoT systems and provides extensive protection from data thefts, cyberattacks, and data corruption. Blockchain with its distributed architecture offers peer-to-peer networking and enables auditable and transparent transactions. This chapter explores the concept of IIoT and its limitations, and the need for deploying blockchain mechanisms in the IIoT paradigm. We further analyze blockchain technology and how it can reinforce IIoT systems. Existing systems of blockchain in the IIoT ecosystems and relevant use cases are also explored. As conventional systems struggle to handle the scale of data operations handled by the IIoT, blockchain has emerged as a viable solution to reinforce and reform existing systems.</td>

To define semantics for the logic we enrich temporal epistemic Kripke models with probability functions defined on sets of possible worlds. We use this framework to model and reason about probabilistic properties of the blockchain protocol, which is in essence probabilistic since ledgers are immutable with high probabilities. We prove the probabilistic convergence for reaching the consensus of the protocol.</td>

Smaller transaction size and higher transaction efficiency are the essential requirements of the blockchain. However, these requirements are closely related to the efficiency of the encryption algorithms that blockchain uses. In this paper, we have analyzed and compared the performance of Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm that is most commonly used in blockchain by having a general consideration of a transaction size and transaction efficiency. We aim to provide a better understanding of the reason behind their extensive use in the blockchain. We hope that our evaluation and analysis of these two encryption algorithms can help promote the further development of blockchain.</td>

The GHOST variant is touted as offering superior performance compared to Bitcoin (potentially offering block production speed up by a factor of more than 40) without a security loss.

      <td>Blockchain technology can be incorporated into new systems to facilitate modern Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). For example, it is widely acknowledged that the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has introduced complexity to the cyberspace, however, incident responders should also realise the advantages presented by these new “Digital Witnesses” (DW) to support their investigation. Logs generated by IoT devices can help in the process of event reconstruction, but their integrity -and therefore admissibility- can be achieved only if a Chain-of-Custody (CoC) is maintained within the wider context of an on-going digital investigation. Likewise, the transition to electronic documentation improves data availability, legibility, the utility of notes, and therefore enhances the communication between stakeholders. However, without a proof of validity, these data could be falsified. For example, in an application area such as eHealth, there is a requirement to maintain various existing (and new) rules and regulations concerning authorship, auditing, and the integrity of medical records. Lacking data control could lead to system abuse, fraud and severe compromise of service quality. These concerns can be resolved by implementing an online CoC. In this paper, we discuss the value and means of utilising Blockchain in modern systems to support DFIR. we demonstrate the value of Blockchain to improve the implementation of Digital Forensic Models and discuss why law enforcement and incident responders need to understand Blockchain technology. Furthermore, the admissibility of a Digital Evidence to a Court of Law requires chronological documentation. Hence, we discuss how the CoC can be sustained based on a distributed ledger. Finally, we provide a practical scenario related to eHealth to demonstrate the value of this approach to introduce forensic readiness to computer systems and enable better Police interventions.</td>

H4.0 relies on cyber-physical systems managing several devices and software components. and the exchange of a huge amount of sensible data that includes medical records. Medical records can be much more valuable to criminals than financial data, indeed the control of medical data allows criminals to plan and realize different frauds, that the victims may identify only too late. Furthermore, the complexity of a typical H4.0 cyber-physical system makes healthcare records particularly vulnerable. Blockchain is today an emerging technology for the management of data that may avoid or mitigate the impact of threats related to data storage and management, in general, and to the administration, in particular, of healthcare records. The blockchain technology relies on cryptography and distributed consensus to guarantee data integrity, accountability and security. The exploitation of such technology is considered in this chapter, showing the advantages when used in a H4.0 scenario.</td>

Blockchain technology in the healthcare industry has received considerable research attention in recent years. This study conducts a review to substantially analyse and map the research landscape of current technologies, mainly the use of blockchain in healthcare applications, into a coherent taxonomy. The present study systematically searches all relevant research articles on blockchain in healthcare applications in three accessible databases, namely, ScienceDirect, IEEE and Web of Science, by using the defined keywords ‘blockchain’, ‘healthcare’ and ‘electronic health records’ and their variations. The final set of collected articles related to the use of blockchain in healthcare application is divided into three categories. The first category includes articles (i.e. 43/58 scientific articles) that attempted to develop and design healthcare applications integrating blockchain, particularly those on new architecture, system designs, framework, scheme, model, platform, approach, protocol and algorithm. The second category includes studies (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) that attempted to evaluate and analyse the adoption of blockchain in the healthcare system. Finally, the third category comprises review and survey articles (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) related to the integration of blockchain into healthcare applications. The final articles for review are discussed on the basis of five aspects: (1) year of publication, (2) nationality of authors, (3) publishing house or journal, (4) purpose of using blockchain in health applications and the corresponding contributions and (5) problem types and proposed solutions. Additionally, this study provides identified motivations, open challenges and recommendations on the use of blockchain in healthcare applications. The current research contributes to the literature by providing a detailed review of feasible alternatives and identifying the research gaps. Accordingly, researchers and developers are provided with appealing opportunities to further develop decentralised healthcare applications through a comprehensive discussion of about the importance of blockchain and its integration into various healthcare applications.</td>

Such health monitoring and support are getting immensely popular among both patients and doctors as it does not require physical movement which is always not possible for elderly people who lives mostly alone in current socio-economic situations. Healthcare Informatics plays a key role in such circumstances. The huge amount of raw data emanating from sensors needs to be processed applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms for useful information extraction to develop an intelligent knowledge base for providing an appropriate solution as and when required. The real challenge lies in data storage and retrieval preserving security, privacy, reliability and availability requirements. Health data saved in Electronic medical record (EMR) is generally saved in a client-server database where central coordinator does access control like create, access, update, or delete of health records. But in smart and remote healthcare supported by enabling technologies such as Sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, Deep learning, Big data, etc. EMR needs to be accessed in a distributed manner among multiple stakeholders involved such as hospitals, doctors, research labs, patients’ relatives, insurance provider, etc. Hence, it is to be ensured that health data be protected from unauthorized access specifically to maintain data integrity using advanced distributed security techniques such as blockchain.\n</td>

Since the first crafting of absorptive capacity theory in the beginning of 1990s, there has been ample research on its application in medium and large companies. The contribution of this study is that it assesses the concept of absorptive capacity and its impact on firm performance in start-ups. The methodological approach involves quantitative data analysis using a survey applied to a sample of 44 blockchain start-ups measuring the following variables: acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. We analyzed firm performance through a variety of concepts previously tested in other studies, sales growth, profit growth, growth in market share, and growth in return on capital, and found a positive relationship between AC and firm performance in blockchain start-ups. However, based on our findings, we cannot conclude that blockchain start-ups are more successful because of their AC. Therefore, we suggest further examination of items more specific to the demands of an increasingly digital economy.</td>

      <td>Distributed file storage provides reliable access to data through redundancy spread on distributed nodes. Various application scenarios emerge, such as include data centers, storage in wireless networks and peer-to-peer storage systems. Storing data by using code, such as an erasure code, calls for less redundancy compared with simple replication in terms of reliability. Nevertheless, since data fragments are periodically replaced when some nodes fail, a key acute question is how to generate encoded data fragments in a distributed way when transferring as little data as possible over the network. For a coded system, a new node to repair from a node failure is to download subsets of data from some surviving nodes, reconstructs some lost coded blocks by using the downloaded fragments, and stores them at the new node. This procedure is not optimal. In this paper, we introduce blockchain to protect distributed data in terms of node failure and etc. We show that blockchain can significantly improve the integrity and credibility in distributed file storage systems. Furthermore, we harvest theory discovery of blockchain in distributed file storage system.</td>

Any security flaw occurring during authentication with a centralized environment affects the connectivity of devices in the network and the transaction of data in IoT. As a solution, Blockchain technology emerges to use in IoT network for the betterment. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare IT systems. In IoMT environment, a private Blockchain network is created containing all the participants of a hospital including doctors, lab technicians, patients and clinical laboratories etc., There exists no necessity to carry the report by the patients during every visit, as the data is already available in the network. The data is completely decentralized to avoid failure, data loss and to provide faster recovery. Whenever a change is attempted by a third person in the database, a notification is sent to all the members of the group. Since this is a private Blockchain, it requires an additional level of authentication. Whenever any new person requires being a part of the network a document for proof is provided. The data is transparent, so any modification done by any member of the group will get notified to everyone. An additional level security can be provided for data transfer based upon the mutually agreed security parameter and any modification in database is accepted upon approval of all members. In addition, when a hospital is not able to provide any sophisticated treatment to the patient due to lack of medical facilities, recommendation is sent to the patient; thereby new hospital added to the private network after successful authentication to access patient’s record. To access record, quantum key may be generated and distributed across the network.\n</td>

Blockchain platforms are currently being used across the world in several government processes and business domains, for their unique characteristics. Even though blockchain shows potentials in its ability to provide a limitless number of inventive commercial trading, payments, government, healthcare, military and other critical applications, they face a security weakness on their recent prominent breaches of exchanges. Hence, there remain major security issues that are essential to be overcome before blockchain adopts the mainstream. And currently, this technology relies on hardware security modules (HSM) for the management and protection of their digital keys. The HSM generates key pairs, has secure storage and can off-load cryptographic operations from the entire system. But recently, FPGAs are preferred for hardware realization of algorithms considering its flexibility, low cost and long-term maintenance. It also has an advantage of reconfigurable or reprogrammable hardware design whenever new security or adaptation of an algorithm is required to support higher security levels. The paper presents a review of hardware security modules and proposed to enhance the scalability and reliability of the HSM by implementing it with the silicon-based secure module. Integrating PUF technology into the chip for storing and securing encryption or private keys, its security level can also be improved.</td>

      <td>Today, supply chain finance is a very important topic. Traditional supply chains rely on banks to support the related financing activities and services. With the emergence of blockchain technology, more and more companies in different industries have considered using it to support supply chain finance. In this paper, we study supply chain financing problems in supply chains selling fashionable products. Modeling under the standard newsvendor problem setting with a single manufacturer and a single retailer employing a revenue sharing contract, we develop analytical models for both the traditional and blockchain-supported supply chains. We derive the optimal contracting and quantity decisions in each supply chain with Nash bargaining between the manufacturer and retailer. We analytically show how the revenue sharing contract can coordinate both types of supply chains. We then compare the optimal systems performances between the two supply chains. We prove that the blockchain-supported supply chain incurs a lower level of operational risk than the traditional supply chain. We have shown that if the service fees by banks are sufficiently high, adopting blockchain technology is a mean-risk dominating policy which brings a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. For robustness checking, we examine other commonly seen supply chain contracts and alternative risk measures, and analytically reveal that the results remain valid.</td>

Creation of identity document requires an individual to convince appropriate government authority by producing all supporting proofs of identity declaration. This process is vulnerable as it can result in the accumulation of power to the individual issuing the identity document. Also, the authentication process involves sharing the copy of already issued identity proof. Many a time, identity proofs are shared with individuals who cannot be trusted for their integrity. This can result in misuse of the identity documents for socially evil activities. Blockchain provides a decentralized trust-less network which nobody owns, but everyone can use. The proposed system provides solution to the identity management problem by putting personal identifiers on blockchain. Using blockchain technology, a system has been proposed to create, manage and confirm an individual’s identity and credentials in a much secure way. Sharing of relevant information would be possible only with the identity owner’s will. Hence, creation of false identity documents will be prevented.</td>

It’s true that blockchain has its roots in cryptocurrency applications and is still evolving for that purpose in the financial sector, but many other organisations across different industries are beginning to see the non-crypto use cases where this mechanism to record data that cannot be changed or reversed or apply as smart contracts (as a way to time-stamp transactions between parties) is becoming extremely relevant and purposeful. A variety of industry sectors, besides Finance, has undertaken the use of these distributed technologies and beneficial attributes of blockchain from the healthcare and pharmaceutical, real estate, retail and supply chain, legal and publishing. Organisations have flexible options to run blockchain as permissionless (anyone can join), permissioned (where those need to be invited) or hybrid (a consortium type) and whether data should be held on-chain or off-chain. With industry entering its fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) the addition of blockchain as a complimentary technology has its place and there are some industries very suited to the significant impact it may bring. Also, the advances of Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has meant more pressures on potential impacts to data and the ripple effects that cyber-attacks may cause. This has also become complicated, as cyber-attacks have become much more sophisticated over recent years with the different configuration types and various industry sectors have suffered from a range of these different attack vectors, resulting in some devastating outcomes. These have manifested in the shape of ransomware, malware, manipulation methods, phishing and spear-phishing. Whilst data breaches are a serious incident, in most organisations, there is a growing concern regarding attacks that are designed to have a more destructive effect such as the Ukraine cyber-attack in 2015 that resulted in a shutdown of the power grid or the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 that caused widespread chaos with healthcare institutions unable to carry out any tasks since access to data/systems was unavailable.</td>

      <td>The insurance industry plays a key role in any modern economy. Blockchain technology promises to completely revolutionise the industry, with several bold claims made in terms of facilitating and speeding up claims settlements and improving fraud management. In this paper, we examine the factors that may influence the extent of blockchain proliferation and penetration within the insurance industry. We adopt the STEEP framework to analyse the key social, technological, environmental, economic and political/legal issues that may impact the insurance industry’s openness or otherwise to blockchain, drawing on a diverse, multi-disciplinary literature. We supplement this with data drawn from 565 European respondents to a survey on blockchain use within the insurance industry. The results emphasise the need for the industry to properly understand and communicate how blockchain can be implemented across different insurance tasks in order to obtain a more tangible view of its benefits for staff, management and customers alike.</td>

      <td>In the context of combating crime, government institutions in several countries have instituted units or sectors specialized in investigation and intelligence activities to act in different areas and expertise’s. Due to the considerable concern with security and confidentiality, as well as the characteristics inherent to the context of these units, an opportunity arises to adopt alternative solutions aimed at the management, storage and sharing of digital assets. Due to the characteristics of decentralization, enhanced security, tamper-proof, traceability and transparency, in recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy and penetrated different domains. However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of in investigation and intelligence units is rather unexplored in academic literature. Exploring the main characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper presents an overview of different application trends of blockchain technology, and propose the use of blockchain as a support mechanism in the management, storage and sharing of generated digital assets in the context of these specialized units.</td>

      <td>The huge increase in data usage and the rapid development of new technologies such as cloud, IoT, and has also led to the exponential increase in cyber threats online. Anonymity and privacy services have equally seen an exceptional growth rate since the introduction of Blockchain and Tor network, as more individuals demand anonymous services away from the traditional centralised offerings, but also seek more security and privacy. This chapter will review quantitative analysis undertaken to critically evaluate Tor and Blockchain as emerging technologies, by an in-depth comparison of their security and privacy properties. Further analysis is undertaken by utilising network and data points that highlight the necessity of urgent deployment of innovative methods to protect users’ anonymity utilising Blockchain application over the Tor network. By undertaking experimental analysis, it is possible to determine Tor packets from common packets and raises the question on possibilities of cyberattacks leading to loss of personable identifiable information (PII) and de-anonymization.</td>

      <td>The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents a network of implantable or wearable medical devices that continuously collect medical data about the patient’s health status. These data are heavy, sensitive and require high level of security. With the emergence of blockchain technology, researchers are focusing on using blockchain strategies to bring security to healthcare applications. However, such integration is very difficult and challenging due to the different requirements in these two technologies. We present in this paper a technical review of existing solutions applying blockchain technology on IoMT. We analyze these studies, discuss the proposed architectures and how they managed the integration challenges. The open issues regarding the application of blockchain over IoMT are also specified.</td>

Blockchain is distributed public ledger that can hold permanent records in a secured way. Blockchain ensures that transactions can never be modified. Blockchain also provide data transparency, integrity, security and interoperability. To address the need for patients to manage and control their electronic health records, blockchain technology could be successfully applied in the healthcare sector. Using blockchain decentralized storage of patient information is possible. Health records which are up to date will be accessed by authenticated user only. It is possible for patient to share his records with other doctors for diagnosis of diseases for example chronological disease, thus blockchain provides personal data transaction in health care sector using blockchain. In this paper we reviewed different applications of blockchain in healthcare system and also challenges for deployment of this technology in healthcare industry.</td>

      <td>While most Blockchain technology seems to be new, applications of this technology, beyond electronic payments, such as supply chains, health care and asset management appear every day. All of them stem from the distinctive advantages of Blockchain technology; volatility, trust, transparency and reliability. Blockchain already affects the banking and accounting sectors, and all its economy-abided activities. Under this context, the purpose of this study is to explore the knowledge and the attitude of Greek accountants towards Blockchain technology and its advantages and disadvantages with regards to the accounting area. For the analysis, a convenient sample of 100 Greek accountants was used. Results reveal that Greek accountants use digital infrastructure and technology, but they report low knowledge on Blockchain technology and lack of trust in using it for their transactions. The questionnaire has been factor analyzed and the following factors emerged: (a) The attitude of the accountants, (b) The need for validated files and reliability of sources, (c) The reliability of Blockchain technology, and (d) The need to eliminate intermediaries. Implications for providing more training through seminars and education for the accounting sector, businesses and employees are discussed.</td>

      <td>The blockchain technology emerged in 2008 as a distributed peer to peer network structure, capable of ensuring security for transactions made using the Bitcoin digital currency, without the need for third party intermediaries to validate them. Although its beginning was linked to cryptocurrencies, its use has diversified over the recent years. There are various projects using the blockchain technology to perform document validation, electronic voting, tokenization of non-perishable goods, and many others. With its increasing use, concern arises with possible attacks that could threaten the integrity of the consensus of the chain. One of the well-known attacks to the blockchain consensus mechanism is the selfish mining attack, in which malicious nodes can deflect their behavior from the standard pattern by not immediately disclosing their newly mined blocks. This malicious behavior can result in a disproportionate share of rewards for those nodes, especially if they have a significant processing power. The goal of this paper is to present a simple heuristic to detect the presence of selfish mining attack (and variants) in blockchain networks that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The proposal is to signal when the blockchain fork height deviates from the standard, indicating when the network is under the influence of such attacks.</td>
